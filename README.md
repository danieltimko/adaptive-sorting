# Adaptive sorting benchmarks

This repository contains the implementation of selected adaptive sorting algorithms and of a
benchmark to measure their performance on inputs with different levels of presortedness.

Selected adaptive sorting algorithms: Natural Merge Sort, Timsort, Powersort.  
The Python reference sorting algorithm (`sorted()`) and traditional top-down Merge Sort (used as baseline) are
also included in the benchmarks.

## Project structure

- `algorithms/*` - Implementations of the selected adaptive sorting algorithms
- `benchmark_versions/*` - Same algorithms as in `algorithms/*`, slightly altered to measure performance without affecting functionality
- `output/graphs/*` - Plots (.png) generated by the benchmarks
- `output/raw_data/*` - Raw data (.csv) generated by the benchmarks
- `config.py` - Configurations for the input data to run the benchmarks on
- `random_input_generators.py` - Functions generating random inputs with desired properties (size, level of presortedness, etc.)
- `output_generation.py` - Functions generating the benchmark outputs and visualizations
- `benchmarks.py` - The main class defining and executing the benchmarks
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages required to run the code

## How to run
Prerequisite: Python 3

1. `git clone https://github.com/danieltimko/adaptive-sorting.git`  
Alternatively, download the repository archive.
2. `cd adaptive-sorting`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python benchmarks.py`  
This runs the benchmarks with the default configurations (array sizes, number of datapoints, levels of presortedness, etc.).
If you wish to change these configurations or the subset of executed benchmarks, you can do so directly in `benchmarks.py`.  
Note that the execution of this script might take a very long time (hours), depending on the configured settings.
5. You can find the benchmark results in the `output/` directory.
